# AlexNet
Implementation of AlexNet from Scratch

This is the tensorflow implementation of AlexNet trained on **TPU** of **Google Colab Pro** with 35GB RAM/226GB Disk.


# Dataset
I have used **CIFAR-10** dataset for the basic implementation of AlexNet. 

# Purpose:
The purpose of this implentation is to get a deeper Understanding of the Deep Learning/Computer Vision concepts. Those having a new start in this field can start their practice from this basic implementation and if they have enough resources they can use ImageNet for training as well.

# Results:
   **Training**: loss: 0.0432 - accuracy: 0.9868 - val_loss: 0.7358 - val_accuracy: 0.8227
   **Test**:  loss: 0.8405 - accuracy: 0.8060
   I have got **80.06% accuracy** on CIFAR-10 image dataset. This is a quite good accuracy on this quite complex low resolution images.
