# AlexNet
Implementation of AlexNet from Scratch

This is the tensorflow implementation of AlexNet.


# Dataset
I have used CIFAR-10 dataset for the basic implementation of AlexNet. 

# Purpose:
The purpose of this implentation is to get a deeper Understanding of the Deep Learning/Computer Vision concepts. Those having a new start in this field can start their practice from this basic implementation and if they have enough resources they can use ImageNet for training as well.
